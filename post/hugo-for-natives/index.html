<h1 id="context">Context</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;d been thinking about setting up a graphics/rendering blog for a minute now,
but I didn&rsquo;t really know what the path was going to be. I was vaguely aware of
<a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, but hadn&rsquo;t spent anytime investigating what it would
take to get it up and running. The biggest issue for me is that&hellip;I have no
experience with webdev, as a native C/C++ programmer.</p>
<p>One day, I was looking at the big homie <a href="https://therealmjp.github.io/">MJP&rsquo;s blog</a> when I realized
it was now hosted on GitHub Pages. I started to snoop around and noticed he was
using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. I snooped around the <a href="https://github.com/TheRealMJP/TheRealMJP.github.io">blog&rsquo;s backing repo</a>,
and it seemed reasonable enough.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m a webdev rube, I was hoping to find a setup that let me write posts
in Markdown, publish quickly, is well-documented, and have some simple hooks
webpage configuration hooks. Once I started to investigate Hugo, it checked
most of the boxes, along with being fast (at least, advertised as fast) and
well-liked on GitHub. I did try to do some due diligence about other static site
generators, but that seemed like boondoggle, so I settled on Hugo.</p>
<h1 id="hugo-setup">Hugo Setup</h1>
<p>Setting up Hugo was pretty damn easy, and the
<a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Quick Start guide</a> is plenty good to get setup quick.</p>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re on Linux/Mac, you can probably just use your preferred package manager
to grab Hugo. If you&rsquo;re like me, on Windows, you can grab a binary drop on the
<a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases">Hugo releases page</a>. Whatever platform you&rsquo;re on, make sure you
the <code>hugo</code> binary is easily accessible, probably by adding it to your <code>PATH</code>
environment variable.</p>
<h2 id="test-site">Test Site</h2>
<p>If you go through the official Quick Start, it&rsquo;s pretty simple to create a test
site, add a theme, and load up a local server to browse your site. Hugo is as
fast as advertised! Once you start the server, it&rsquo;s actually really simple to
modify your posts and see them get <em>instantly</em> updated on the rendered page!</p>
<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<p>Picking a theme is both fun and stressful, especially when everything is brand
spanking new! The <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">Hugo Themes</a> listing is fun to navigate, and
each theme landing page was useful info, a sample site, and repo.</p>
<p>Once you pick a theme, make sure you snoop around the theme&rsquo;s README to figure
out what you need to know when setting up your theme!</p>
<p>I ended up choosing <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/erblog/">erblog</a> because the test site was appealing,
and the README seemed decent.  While I&rsquo;ve had a couple hiccups during setup,
I&rsquo;ve been satisfied with the experience so far!</p>
<h1 id="github-pages-setup">GitHub Pages Setup</h1>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re comfortable with your test site, you can start the process for
setting up the actual site! You will need two Git repos:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub Pages repo - <code>github.com/\&lt;USERNAME\&gt;/\&lt;USERNAME\&gt;.github.io</code>
<ul>
<li>You need to create an (empty) repo at the above URL. This has to be on GitHub.</li>
<li>e.g. <a href="https://github.com/robbiesri/robbiesri.github.io">https://github.com/robbiesri/robbiesri.github.io</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hugo site container repo
<ul>
<li>This will contain the Hugo site contents that source the static site, along
with the theme and GitHub Pages repo as submodules.</li>
<li>This doesn&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to be on GitHub but I did
<a href="https://github.com/robbiesri/HugoBlog">host mine on GitHub</a> because why not?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You should create your site container repo, add your theme as a submodule, and
add your GitHub Pages repo as a submodule as well! There is a <em>trick</em> with the
Pages submodule: you want to clone it into a folder called <code>public</code> because
that&rsquo;s the default folder that Hugo will generate the static site into. You can
actually choose the folder name, but I just used the default (as suggested by
the <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">Hugo GitHub deployment guide</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; git clone https://github.com/robbiesri/HugoBlog
&gt; hugo new site HugoBlog [--force] 
&gt; cd ./HugoBlog
&gt; git add .
&gt; git commit -m &quot;Initial Hugo infrastructure deployment&quot;
&gt; git submodule add https://github.com/ertuil/erblog themes/erblog
&gt; git commit -m &quot;Add erblog theme&quot;
&gt; git submodule add https://github.com/robbiesri/robbiesri.github.io public
</code></pre><p>Now you can work on creating content you&rsquo;d like to be on  your site! You can
see how your page will look by using <code>hugo server</code>, and pointing your browser to
http://localhost:1313.</p>
<h1 id="deploying-the-site">Deploying the Site</h1>
<p>Once you are ready to push your site to GitHub pages, it&rsquo;s pretty easy! If you
added posts, make sure you update the post meta-data to set their <code>draft</code> status
to <code>false</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd ~./HugoBlog
&gt; hugo
&gt; cd ./public
&gt; git add .
&gt; git commit -m &quot;Initial Hugo-generated static deployment for blog!&quot;
&gt; git push
</code></pre><p>Then surf over to your GitHub page (e.g. robbiesri.github.io) and enjoy the
fruits of your virtual labor (and GitHub and Hugo and your theme).</p>
<h1 id="workflows">Workflows</h1>
<h2 id="drafts">Drafts</h2>
<p>To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t understand <em>what</em> the draft functionality was for.
Either the page was deployed, or it wasn&rsquo;t. As long as I didn&rsquo;t update the
static deployment, I was safe. However, I quickly took advantage of drafting
some posts without worrying about accidentally rolling them out to the public
site (though anyone can check out my open-source Hugo repo ðŸ˜‰).</p>
<h2 id="github-pages-deployment-branch">GitHub Pages Deployment Branch</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site">GitHub Pages publishing doc</a>, I&rsquo;m
supposed to be able to <em>choose</em> what branch my site is published from. However,
when I looked at the actual Settings for my repo&hellip;that wasn&rsquo;t the case!</p>
<p><img src="/post_content/misc/gh_pages_branch.PNG" alt="Settings pic from my repo"></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mind being fixed to <code>master</code> for publishing, but I wish the docs matched
the actual behavior. I was confused when I tried changing the branch (since I
don&rsquo;t use <code>master</code> as the default branch if I can help it).</p>
<h2 id="deployment-activity-log">Deployment Activity Log</h2>
<p>When I was trying to figure out if my site was actually deployed, I found that
there was an <a href="https://github.com/robbiesri/robbiesri.github.io/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages">activity log</a> that GitHub provides:</p>
<p><img src="/post_content/misc/gh_pages_activity.PNG" alt="robbiesri.github.io Activity Log"></p>
<p>With this, I was able to see which commit the current deployment was grabbing.
This helped me verify and understand if my site was working as expected.</p>
<h1 id="pending-stuff">Pending Stuff</h1>
<h2 id="markdown-editor">Markdown Editor</h2>
<p>One of the benefits of Google was a really nice internal Markdown editor in the
web-based IDE, Cider. It provided instant visualization of the Markdown I was
writing, a really great integrated Markdown formatter (like <code>.clang-format</code> for
Markdown), and an easy full render of the generated site (that was also easy to
share).</p>
<p>I&hellip;don&rsquo;t have that out in the wild! That I know of, at least&hellip; I have snooped
around for alternatives. I drafted this very post in <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>,
and it was pretty fun! However, it doesn&rsquo;t really offer any formatting support.
And if you are using locally hosted images, well&hellip;it doesn&rsquo;t work with an
online editor.</p>
<p>I usually write local Markdown in VS Code, and the built-in visualizer
(<code>Ctrl-Shift-v</code>) is pretty great. But I don&rsquo;t like toggling between tabs. There
is support for <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown">side-by-side viz</a>, but the last time I tested it, it
didn&rsquo;t really work. I also found an interesting
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mervin.markdown-formatter">Markdown formatting extension</a>. I think I&rsquo;ll stick with VS
Code for now.</p>
<h2 id="hugo-themeconfig-management">Hugo Theme/Config Management</h2>
<p>You gotta pay the cost to be the boss, but I was slightly annoyed with the time
it took for me to figure out how to manage <code>config.toml</code> and the per-post
meta-data. It&rsquo;s surprisingly hard to find <em>good</em> examples for how to set this
stuff up. I can find thousands of Hugo sites, but which ones are modelling best
practices? It&rsquo;s even more difficult to find good theme citizenry, especially
when the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/erblog/">erblog sample site</a> isn&rsquo;t terribly complex (which is
fine).</p>
<p>On top of that, figuring out <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies#configure-taxonomies">Hugo taxonomies</a> was really
frustrating. Maybe it&rsquo;s more intuitive to a day-to-day webdev, but it took
me a while to figure out how to manage this correctly.</p>
